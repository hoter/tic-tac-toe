# Tic-tac-toe
It's a start applciation. I use this idea for learning new programming languages, frameworks, technologies. At this time there are 3 versions:

1. [JS](https://github.com/hoter/tic-tac-toe)
2. [Golang](https://github.com/hoter/tic-tac-toe/tree/golang)
3. [Backbone](https://github.com/hoter/tic-tac-toe/tree/backbone)

I'm sure that I'll learn more new cool thinks, so I'll add new branches.
